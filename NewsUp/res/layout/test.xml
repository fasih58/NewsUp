&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suggested Sunday that he would eliminate several federal agencies if he were elected president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Asked on "Fox News Sunday"&amp;#160;how he would cut spending, Trump named the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency as potential targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"No, I'm not cutting services, but I'm cutting spending. But I may cut Department of Education. I believe Common Core is a very bad thing. I believe that we should be -- you know, educating our children from Iowa, from New Hampshire, from South Carolina, from California, from New York. I think that it should be local education," Trump &lt;a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trump-epa-dept-of-education?utm_content=buffer939cc&amp;#38;utm_medium=social&amp;#38;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;#38;utm_campaign=buffer" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"So the Department of Education is one," he continued. "Environmental Protection, what they do is a disgrace. Every week they come out with new regulations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Asked by host Chris Wallace who would protect the environment in the absence of the EPA, Trump maintained that "we'll be fine with the environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We can leave a little bit, but you can't destroy businesses," he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our &lt;a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'&gt;terms.&lt;/a&gt; It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226143995/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5b36e/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226143995/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5b36e/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226143995/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5b36e/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226143995/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5b36e/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226143995/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5b36e/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226143995/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5b36e/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/241226143995/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5b36e/sc/7/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/241226143995/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5b36e/sc/7/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/241226143995/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5b36e/sc/7/ach.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/241226143995/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5b36e/sc/7/ach.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/241226143995/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5b36e/sc/7/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/241226143995/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5b36e/sc/7/a2t2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.huffingtonpost.com/c/35496/f/677497/s/4ac5b36e/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;

&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez's relationship may very well be over, but&amp;#160;on Saturday night, Jelena fans&amp;#160;received a little glimmer of hope when &lt;a href="http://www.complex.com/music/2015/10/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-new-song-ovo-sound-radio?utm_campaign=musicfb&amp;#38;utm_source=facebook&amp;#38;utm_medium=social&amp;#38;sr_share=facebook" target="_blank"&gt;a song featuring&amp;#160;the former lovebirds was leaked online&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The track, which is currently untitled (though &lt;a href="http://www.gossipcop.com/listen-justin-bieber-strong-selena-gomez-song-audio/" target="_blank"&gt;outlets are reporting it's called "Strong"&lt;/a&gt;) was released on Drake's OVO Sound Radio&amp;#160;but&amp;#160;appears to have been removed. (It remains on YouTube.) It features vocals by both the Biebs and Gomez singing about relationship woes and wishing things could have worked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neither of the singers has&amp;#160;commented on&amp;#160;the single&amp;#160;and there has been no confirmation on whether it's about their relationship.&amp;#160;However, the song's overall theme and many of the lyrics, including, "I&amp;#8217;m just wishing you were better at communication," and "wishing I was better with the distance" seem to parallel the pair's &lt;a href="http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/g1108/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-relationship-timeline/" target="_blank"&gt;on/off dating history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just have a listen for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div class="embed-asset embed" data-type="embed-asset" data-provider="Embed" data-title=""&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div class="embed-code"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XZs-otvWSgw?wmode=transparent&amp;#38;rel=0&amp;#38;autohide=1&amp;#38;showinfo=0&amp;#38;enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" style="top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both Bieber and Gomez have spoken about their former relationship in recent interviews. Bieber &lt;a href="http://www.complex.com/music/justin-bieber-interview-2015-cover-story" target="_blank"&gt;told Complex&lt;/a&gt;, "We were so in love. Nothing else mattered. We were all about each other," adding, "Your full identity can&amp;#8217;t be in that person. My identity was in her. Her identity was in me." Last week, Gomez &lt;a href="http://www.refinery29.com/2015/10/94843/selena-gomez-revival-growing-up-relationships-interview" target="_blank"&gt;told Refinery29&lt;/a&gt;, "I got my heart broken," but now there's "closure in a very good, healthy way." She also said she was "proud of his journey."&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The leak comes just a couple weeks after Gomez released her latest album, "Revival," and just one month before the release of Bieber's "Purpose." (Coincidence? We think not.) No word yet on whether or not the track will appear on "Purpose," but we'll find out soon enough.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Huffington Post has reached out to reps for both Bieber and Gomez&amp;#160;for&amp;#160;comment.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also on HuffPost:&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our &lt;a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'&gt;terms.&lt;/a&gt; It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226166072/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5f355/sc/38/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226166072/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5f355/sc/38/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226166072/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5f355/sc/38/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226166072/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5f355/sc/38/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226166072/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5f355/sc/38/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226166072/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5f355/sc/38/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/241226166072/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5f355/sc/38/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/241226166072/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5f355/sc/38/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/241226166072/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5f355/sc/38/ach.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/241226166072/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5f355/sc/38/ach.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/241226166072/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5f355/sc/38/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/241226166072/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5f355/sc/38/a2t2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.huffingtonpost.com/c/35496/f/677497/s/4ac5f355/sc/38/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;

The students&amp;#160;have attended campaign events for nearly every candidate running in 2016 and have met the debate&amp;#160;candidates personally.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"[Clinton] came off more personable than she normally does in her persona, and that was something that I really lacked from her before," said senior Sarah Fulton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senior Kevin Maisto agreed that Clinton had a "powerhouse" performance, but also said&amp;#160;he was impressed with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who was forceful and memorable. He said Sanders could have used some more debate preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I wish he could have been a little more sharp with some of his statements," Maisto said. He&amp;#160;also explained his disappointment in former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I kind of wanted him to take away that fringe candidate role and really use this to lead him further in the polls. I don't think his performance proved that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senior Bri Steirer disagreed, saying she was impressed with O'Malley, especially because this was his first performance on a national stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I think he really separated himself from the other candidates," said Steirer, who is president of the Drake Democrats.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;All five students agreed that&amp;#160;while O'Malley's performance wasn't strong enough to win the debate, there still is a path forward for him in Iowa, where he has spent the majority of his campaign time and money. Since O'Malley announced his candidacy at the end of May, he has made 13 visits to Iowa and 69 appearances around the state. That's more than any other candidate vying for the Democratic nomination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The people he has here are willing to go out and knock on doors, they adore him so much," Fulton said. "I would say just give him a little more time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"No one does Iowa like Martin O'Malley," Steirer said. She described seeing&amp;#160;him speak at the &lt;a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/07/31/des-moines-register-political-soapbox-calendar-iowa-state-fair/30852739/" target="_blank"&gt;Des Moines Register's soapbox&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;at the Iowa State Fair. "The tucked-in shirt with the jeans, even the brow wipe. He had it down to a science. The man does Iowa better than anyone I've ever seen. I think he is just a spark waiting to catch into a wildfire because if you can do down-home real estate politicking like Martin O'Malley, that's a special skill and not one that could be taught."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The students had contrasting views on the most talked-about moment of the evening:&amp;#160;the&amp;#160;back-and-forth when Sanders declared he was sick of hearing about Clinton's "damn" email controversy instead of criticizing her for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Junior Caitlin Eames,&amp;#160;who made&amp;#160;it clear that she does not support&amp;#160;Sanders'&amp;#160;policies, praised him for delivering this message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I think Bernie doesn't really care if it was the right political strategic move or not. I think that's how he feels and he's not afraid to express that," she said. "His supporters will probably be encouraged by that."&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fuller&amp;#160;said&amp;#160;that&amp;#160;since Republicans are continuously attacking Clinton over the email controversy, the statement&amp;#160;was a way for Sanders to unite the Democratic party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Steirer had a completely different view of the exchange, given that during the debate Sanders was speaking to a very particular&amp;#160;group of people:&amp;#160;Democratic party elites and activists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"There is a whole other half or more of America who actually cares about what is in those emails and has genuine concern for what is in those emails," she said. "For him to say that the American people are sick of hearing about it is sort of generalizing an overarching opinion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clinton and&amp;#160;Sanders had the lion's share of speaking time in the debate, with Clinton speaking for 30 minutes, 26 seconds and Sanders speaking for 26 minutes,&amp;#160;42 seconds. Some in this focus group thought the speaking time was not balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"[Debate viewers]&amp;#160;got to see their names and see their faces, but I don't think that they got to see them talk as much as what would have been preferable," Fulton said.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;"If you look at Lincoln Chafee, he spoke just under nine&amp;#160;minutes whereas Hillary Clinton spoke over 30 minutes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steirer disagreed, saying&amp;#160;the speaking&amp;#160;time had to do with number of attacks launched at Clinton that required her to respond, though she&amp;#160;agreed there should be a platform where the public could hear more from each candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Logan Kentner, a sophomore and president of the Drake Republicans, noted the advantage the Democratic party has with only five candidates on the debate stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The Republican party had 11 on stage at the last debate. Some of the bottom tier candidates had only a couple minutes to speak total whereas the bottom tier Democratic candidate right now is getting nine minutes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;These men and women at Drake, a private coeducational university in Des Moines, aren't your average college students. They are&amp;#160;actively following the race leading up to the Iowa caucus, attending campaign events and gaining a personal knowledge of the candidates.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Drake student even had a question &lt;a href="http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/56201edce4b06462a13b7340?oakedn29" target="_blank"&gt;featured in the debate&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;#160;the&amp;#160;university campus will host the second Democratic debate,&amp;#160;on&amp;#160;Nov. 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It kind of goes to my head a little bit, going to school in Des Moines," said Steirer. "The candidates are just so accessible so they'll be there to shake your hand, they will be there to listen to your issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eames agreed.&amp;#160;"A number of candidates who I've had the opportunity to get to see in person, once I've seen them in person and shook their hand, my perception of them completely changed," she&amp;#160;said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maisto&amp;#160;said&amp;#160;meeting the candidates before seeing them in action during&amp;#160;the&amp;#160;debate helped him gain a better understanding of their personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Knowing what they are saying on the trail matches up" is important, Maisto said. He made an example of Sanders, whose debate reflected what he has&amp;#160;said campaigning, "so you know that he's authentic."&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;But overall,&amp;#160;the&amp;#160;debate did not alter&amp;#160;the students'&amp;#160;opinions of the candidates, they said. Each candidate's performance&amp;#160;catered to what their supporters&amp;#160;wanted&amp;#160;to see or hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I think what happened up on stage, if anyone were to look at it ahead of time, no one would be surprised," Maisto said. "The fringe candidates will mostly remain the fringe candidates. Hillary Clinton was confident, poised, prepared and she was definitely front-runner status and she kind of solidified that. Bernie ignited his base and talked about the issues he wanted to talk about, which he's been doing on the campaign trail. When you look at it, there weren't any major moments that differentiated from what we've already been talking about, what's already been reported and what's already been taking place on the campaign trail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related&amp;#160;on HuffPost:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our &lt;a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'&gt;terms.&lt;/a&gt; It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226164178/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5d076/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226164178/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5d076/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226164178/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5d076/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226164178/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5d076/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226164178/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5d076/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226164178/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5d076/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/241226164178/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5d076/sc/7/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/241226164178/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5d076/sc/7/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/241226164178/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5d076/sc/7/ach.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/241226164178/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5d076/sc/7/ach.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/241226164178/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5d076/sc/7/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/241226164178/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5d076/sc/7/a2t2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.huffingtonpost.com/c/35496/f/677497/s/4ac5d076/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;

&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Texas officials do not have to make it easier for undocumented immigrants to get birth certificates for their children born in the state while a legal challenge proceeds in court, a federal judge ruled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman declined to grant a preliminary injunction on Friday in a civil rights lawsuit filed in May over how Texas is complying with the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which grants citizenship to any child born on U.S. soil, regardless of parentage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The issue of U.S. citizenship for children of illegal immigrants has become an issue in the November 2016 presidential campaign with Republican candidate Donald Trump questioning the automatic granting of citizenship and Jeb Bush drawing fire for his comments on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Non-profit groups Texas RioGrande Legal Aid and the Texas Civil Rights Project filed the lawsuit on behalf of six children and their immigrant parents alleging the children were denied birth certificates because their parents lacked proof of U.S. citizenship or legal status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit the groups sought a court order that Texas-born children of immigrants are entitled to birth certificates, and said their constitutional rights were being violated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the lawsuit is decided, the groups asked the judge to issue a preliminary injunction to force the state to accept two forms of identification that mothers can easily provide when they seek birth certificates for their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years Texas state officials have become less willing to accept the matricula, an identification card issued by Mexican consulates in the United States, as valid identification for parents seeking birth certificates for their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Judge Pitman said evidence presented by the plaintiffs "raises grave concerns regarding the treatment of citizen children born to immigrant parents."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;But he also said a preliminary injunction was an extreme form of relief and not warranted while he explores the facts of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The evidence establishes defendants have a compelling governmental interest in regulating with care the process of accessing birth certificates," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reuters was not able to immediately reach lawyers for the plaintiffs on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is Maria Isabel Perales Serna, et al vs Texas Department of State Health Services, Vital Statistics Unit, et al, case number 1-15-cv-446 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin Division.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our &lt;a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'&gt;terms.&lt;/a&gt; It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226142408/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5acc1/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226142408/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5acc1/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226142408/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5acc1/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226142408/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5acc1/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226142408/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5acc1/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226142408/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5acc1/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/241226142408/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5acc1/sc/7/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/241226142408/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5acc1/sc/7/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/241226142408/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5acc1/sc/7/ach.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/241226142408/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5acc1/sc/7/ach.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/241226142408/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5acc1/sc/7/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/241226142408/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5acc1/sc/7/a2t2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.huffingtonpost.com/c/35496/f/677497/s/4ac5acc1/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official "Star Wars" Facebook account just revealed the new poster for "The Force Awakens," and it just might be the coolest poster in the galaxy. Or hey, at least it's less basic than the standard "Breakfast at Tiffany's" Audrey Hepburn poster you hung up in your dorm freshman year.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Behold, notable characters from "The Force Awakens" cast, including a side-bun-less Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, Harrison Ford as Han Solo, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3Po.

&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;ALTO, Texas &amp;#8212; An East Texas high school football player has died after collapsing on the sidelines during a game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.jacksonvilleprogress.com/news/update-alto-hs-football-player-dies-after-friday-night-collapse/article_e07afa14-752f-11e5-8e7d-678caedadab9.html" target="_blank"&gt;Jacksonville Daily Progress&lt;/a&gt; reports that Alto High School junior Cam'ron Matthews collapsed Friday night during an Alto home game against Price-Carlisle after reaching the bench from a kickoff return seconds before halftime. He suffered a seizure and doctors, nurses, coaches and trainers worked to keep him breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rural community is 11 miles from the nearest town, so after a 20-minute wait for an ambulance officials summoned a medical helicopter from Tyler, about 50 miles to the north. He remained in critical condition until dying Saturday night. No official cause of death has been determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alto High School has an enrollment of almost 200 students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also on HuffPost:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div class="embed-asset embed" data-type="embed-asset" data-provider="Embed" data-title=""&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div class="embed-code"&gt;&lt;span class="js-fivemin-script"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;(function(){var src_url="https://spshared.5min.com/Scripts/PlayerSeed.js?playList=519165060&amp;height=&amp;width=100&amp;sid=577&amp;origin=SOLR&amp;videoGroupID=0&amp;relatedNumOfResults=100&amp;responsive=true&amp;ratio=wide&amp;align=center&amp;relatedMode=2&amp;relatedBottomHeight=60&amp;companionPos=&amp;hasCompanion=false&amp;autoStart=false&amp;colorPallet=%23FFEB00&amp;videoControlDisplayColor=%23191919&amp;shuffle=0&amp;isAP=1&amp;pgType=cmsPlugin&amp;pgTypeId=addToPost-top&amp;onVideoDataLoaded=track5min.DL&amp;onTimeUpdate=track5min.TC&amp;#38;onVideoDataLoaded=HPTrack.Vid.DL&amp;#38;onTimeUpdate=HPTrack.Vid.TC";if (typeof(commercial_video) == "object") {src_url += "&amp;#38;siteSection="+commercial_video.site_and_category;if (commercial_video.package) {src_url += "&amp;#38;sponsorship="+commercial_video.package;}}var script = document.createElement("script");script.src = src_url;script.async = true;var placeholder = document.querySelector(".js-fivemin-script");placeholder.parentElement.replaceChild(script, placeholder);})();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our &lt;a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'&gt;terms.&lt;/a&gt; It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226141320/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5a838/sc/13/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226141320/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5a838/sc/13/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226141320/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5a838/sc/13/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226141320/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5a838/sc/13/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226141320/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5a838/sc/13/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226141320/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5a838/sc/13/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/241226141320/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5a838/sc/13/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/241226141320/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5a838/sc/13/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/241226141320/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5a838/sc/13/ach.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/241226141320/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5a838/sc/13/ach.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/241226141320/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5a838/sc/13/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/241226141320/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5a838/sc/13/a2t2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.huffingtonpost.com/c/35496/f/677497/s/4ac5a838/sc/13/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Lamar Odom's hospitalization on Tuesday, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-jenner-lamar-odom_561efe44e4b0c5a1ce62044f" target="_blank"&gt;members of the Kardashian family&lt;/a&gt; have been by the NBA player's side, hoping for his recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Friday, multiple outlets reported that &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lamar-odom-conscious-and-breathing_56215364e4b02f6a900c4927" target="_blank"&gt;Odom had emerged from a coma&lt;/a&gt; and was breathing without the help of machinery. Kim Kardashian's latest Instagram post seems to match up with those stories, as Kanye West's wife shared with her 49.3 million Instagram followers the news that Odom is smiling again. She posted an old photo of herself and Odom, writing, "I have faith in you. I believe in the power of prayer and positive energy! Thank you all for your prayers! Lammy - I'm so happy Kendall &amp;#38; I could make you smile today! God is good!"&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div class="embed-asset embed" data-type="embed-asset" data-provider="Embed" data-title=""&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div class="embed-code"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version="5" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"&gt;&lt;div style="padding:8px;"&gt; &lt;div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:45.3323903819% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"&gt; &lt;div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;"&gt; &lt;a href="https://instagram.com/p/890p98OS2I/" style=" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;" target="_blank"&gt;I have faith in you.

&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Two Democratic presidential candidates indicated on Friday they support an investigation of oil giant ExxonMobil for concealing research on fossil fuels&amp;#8217; contribution to climate change, following a &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/exxon-climate-change-cover-up_562133a2e4b08d94253eff49" target="_blank"&gt;call&lt;/a&gt; by&amp;#160;two House Democrats &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;for a Justice Department probe into the matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&amp;#8220;We held tobacco companies responsible for lying about cancer. Let&amp;#8217;s do the same for oil companies &amp;#38; climate change,&amp;#8221; former Maryland Gov. Martin O&amp;#8217;Malley (D) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MartinOMalley/status/655116504699027456" target="_blank"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, linking to an article about the&amp;#160;House members' request for an inquiry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div class="embed-asset embed" data-type="embed-asset" data-provider="Embed" data-title=""&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div class="embed-code"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We held tobacco companies responsible for lying about cancer.

Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.) &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/exxon-climate-change-cover-up_562133a2e4b08d94253eff49"&gt;sent a letter&lt;/a&gt; to Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Friday asking her to initiate an investigation of ExxonMobil for conducting a &amp;#8220;campaign to deceive the American people about the known risks of fossil fuels in causing climate change." &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The letter is based on reports from&amp;#160;Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times earlier this month detailing Exxon&amp;#8217;s efforts to cast doubt on the role of fossil fuels in driving climate change, despite knowledge of its causes dating back decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inside Climate News &lt;a href="http://insideclimatenews.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken"&gt;told the story&lt;/a&gt; of how one of Exxon&amp;#8217;s own scientists told the company&amp;#8217;s management in 1977 that carbon dioxide emitted through the burning of fossil fuels was the "most likely&amp;#8221; driver of global climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;And the LA Times &lt;a href="http://graphics.latimes.com/exxon-arctic/"&gt;documented how&lt;/a&gt; Exxon &amp;#8220;sought to downplay the certainty of global warming,&amp;#8221; even as it charged its scientists with assessing how to prepare for the phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lieu and DeSaulnier compared Exxon&amp;#8217;s conduct to cigarette companies&amp;#8217; public denial of the harmful effects of tobacco decades earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kate Sheppard contributed reporting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also on HuffPost:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Odom was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ramonashelburne/status/655403104490295297" target="_blank"&gt;"conversational"&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday and was able to text and &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-lamar-odom-updates-20151017-story.html" target="_blank"&gt;speak sentences&lt;/a&gt;, according to reports from ESPN and the Los Angeles Times. Most of his communication, however, comes through &lt;a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/707642/lamar-odom-making-great-progress-after-waking-up-from-coma-but-setbacks-remain-possible" target="_blank"&gt;a simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down&lt;/a&gt;, according to E!

News reported on Sunday. With his&amp;#160;breathing tube removed, E! reported, Odom passed a swallow test -- another hurdle overcome&amp;#160;as doctors gauge if he&amp;#160;has&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lamar-odom-brain-damage_5620f903e4b06462a13ba022?utm_hp_ref=sports&amp;#38;ir=Sports&amp;#38;section=sports" target="_blank"&gt;suffered any brain damage&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Odom was hospitalized on Tuesday after being &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lamar-odom-collapsed_561db166e4b028dd7ea5ad12" target="_blank"&gt;found unconscious&lt;/a&gt; in a Nevada brothel, reportedly &lt;a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/706433/drugs-found-in-lamar-odom-s-system-condition-being-treated-as-overdose-as-brain-damage-likely" target="_blank"&gt;suffering from a drug overdose&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;For visiting family and friends at&amp;#160;Sunrise Hospital &amp;#38; Medical Center in Las Vegas, perhaps the most joyous bit of progress in Odom's recovery came in the form of a classic Odom smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The singer has been working on her third solo album for the past year with collaborators such as Pharrell Williams, Ryan Tedder and Charli XCX. Her recent releases include &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uo9oy-Eqo4" target="_hplink"&gt;“Baby Don’t Lie”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4lRINPVF50" target="_hplink"&gt;“Spark The Fire.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On a related note, No Doubt’s seminal album “Tragic Kingdom,” which put Stefani on the map with songs like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHzOOQfhPFg" target="_hplink"&gt;“Just A Girl”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR3Vdo5etCQ" target="_hplink"&gt;“Don’t Speak,”&lt;/a&gt; celebrated its &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/10/gwen-stefani-was-the-perfect-preteen-idol.html" target="_hplink"&gt;20th anniversary&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. &lt;p&gt;-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our &lt;a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'&gt;terms.&lt;/a&gt; It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226101258/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5806e/sc/38/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226101258/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5806e/sc/38/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226101258/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5806e/sc/38/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226101258/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5806e/sc/38/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226101258/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5806e/sc/38/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226101258/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5806e/sc/38/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/241226101258/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5806e/sc/38/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/241226101258/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5806e/sc/38/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/241226101258/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5806e/sc/38/ach.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/241226101258/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5806e/sc/38/ach.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/241226101258/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5806e/sc/38/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/241226101258/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac5806e/sc/38/a2t2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.huffingtonpost.com/c/35496/f/677497/s/4ac5806e/sc/38/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;

&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON -- Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney just couldn't bring himself to say he'd vote for Donald Trump should he be the&amp;#160;Republican&amp;#160;nominee, insisting on Sunday that it's unlikely&amp;#160;Trump&amp;#160;will make it that far.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I would vote for the nominee of the Republican party, and I don't believe that's going to be Donald Trump," Romney said during an interview on CNN's "State of the Union" when asked whether he would vote for Trump over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Romney has made clear that he doesn't think Trump is good for the GOP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Donald Trump has said a number of things which are &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/16/politics/mitt-romney-donald-trump-comments/" target="_blank"&gt;hurtful&lt;/a&gt; and he has said that they were childish in some respects and I think will be potentially problematic either in a primary or in a general election if he were to become the nominee," Romney said Thursday on Democratic strategist David Axelrod's podcast.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Sunday, he noted that presidential candidates go up and down in the polls, so it's still too early to predict who the nominee will be. He said there were some "good folks" in the race, praising Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;When pressed, he said neurosurgeon Ben Carson is "a very gentle and sweet soul who speaks his mind."&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div class="embed-asset embed" data-type="embed-asset" data-provider="Embed" data-title=""&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div class="embed-code"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want more updates from Amanda?

&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not only did Tracy Morgan give us a &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tracy-morgan-snl-monologue_56239e34e4b0bce34701009a" target="_blank"&gt;"30 Rock" reunion&lt;/a&gt; on "Saturday Night Live" this weekend, he also brought back one of his most beloved characters: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS3EBKOMCQg" target="_blank"&gt;Brian Fellow&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the sketch, Fellow, "an enthusiastic young man with a sixth-grade education and an abiding love for all God&amp;#8217;s creatures,"&amp;#160;spoke to both a live beaver and a live camel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;As per usual, Fellow showed little interest in the actual animals on&amp;#160;his "Safari Planet" show&amp;#160;and tried to keep the attention on himself by repeating his signature line, "I'm Brian Fellow!" The camel &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; try to steal the spotlight, but Fellow wasn't having it.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I can't see, camel!" he said as he led the desert animal&amp;#160;out of the frame.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div class="embed-asset embed" data-type="embed-asset" data-provider="Embed" data-title=""&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div class="embed-code"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CS3EBKOMCQg?wmode=transparent&amp;#38;rel=0&amp;#38;autohide=1&amp;#38;showinfo=0&amp;#38;enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" style="top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brian Fellow was first introduced to the "SNL" audience back in 1999, and through the years, the sketch has included appearances by&amp;#160;celebrities like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4hZO-TEpzE" target="_blank"&gt;Jason Sudeikis&lt;/a&gt;, Matt Damon and Sarah Michelle Gellar.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also on HuffPost:&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our &lt;a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'&gt;terms.&lt;/a&gt; It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226161225/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac4cdaf/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226161225/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac4cdaf/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226161225/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac4cdaf/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226161225/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac4cdaf/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226161225/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac4cdaf/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/241226161225/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac4cdaf/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/241226161225/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac4cdaf/sc/7/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/241226161225/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac4cdaf/sc/7/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/241226161225/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac4cdaf/sc/7/ach.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/241226161225/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac4cdaf/sc/7/ach.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/241226161225/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac4cdaf/sc/7/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/241226161225/u/437/f/677497/c/35496/s/4ac4cdaf/sc/7/a2t2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.huffingtonpost.com/c/35496/f/677497/s/4ac4cdaf/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;

            <description>
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON -- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Sunday that he&amp;#160;supports President Barack Obama's decision to keep troops in Afghanistan, prolonging the war beyond 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama announced last week that he would&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-afghanistan-withdraw-droops_561f7bebe4b0c5a1ce6217e2" target="_blank"&gt;keep&amp;#160;5,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;after he leaves office in 2017, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-stay-in-afghanistan_561fe030e4b0c5a1ce626aa3" target="_blank"&gt;breaking his promise&lt;/a&gt; to end the war during his tenure. He originally planned to&amp;#160;maintain only a small military presence based at the U.S. embassy there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;During an interview on ABC's "This Week" on Sunday morning, host George Stephanopoulos asked Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate, whether he backs keeping U.S. troops in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Well, yeah, I won't give you the exact number. Clearly, we do not want to see the Taliban gain more power, and I think we need a certain nucleus of American troops present in Afghanistan to try to provide the training and support the Afghan army needs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton also said Friday that she thought Obama had made "&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/10/16/clinton-embraces-obama-plan-for-troops-afghanistan/XbbBVwGGgqbSMLWgB54KgI/story.html" target="_blank"&gt;the right decision&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I admire the fact that the president has very strong positions about trying to end wars and bring people home --&amp;#160;which is exactly the right place to be in --&amp;#160;but is not so doctrinaire, absolutist that no matter what the circumstances are that he&amp;#8217;s going to stick to his position," Clinton said in a Boston Globe interview. "You have a position of responsibility and a real obligation to try to make the best decisions possible, and I know that's what he did on this one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama said that the 9,800 U.S. troops currently in Afghanistan will now remain there through most of 2016, before dropping to 5,500 at the end of 2016 or in early 2017.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I know that many of you have grown weary of this conflict," Obama said in a White House address Thursday. "As you are well aware, I do not support the idea of endless war, and I have repeatedly argued against marching into open-ended military conflicts that do not serve our core security interests. Yet given what's at stake in Afghanistan, and the opportunity for a stable and committed ally that can partner with us in preventing the emergence of future threats, and the fact that we have an international coalition, I am firmly convinced that we should make this extra effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div class="embed-asset embed" data-type="embed-asset" data-provider="Embed" data-title=""&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div class="embed-code"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want more updates from Amanda?

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (AP) &amp;#8212; NBC is enabling Donald Trump's "hateful speech" about Hispanics by giving him a platform as host of "Saturday Night Live" and should pull the invitation, a coalition of Hispanic advocacy groups said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a letter to NBC Universal CEO Stephen Burke and "SNL" executive producer Lorne Michaels, the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda said it applauded the company when it severed its beauty-pageant ties with Trump over his remarks about Hispanic immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trump hasn't apologized for his "bigoted comments" that included describing some Mexicans in the United States illegally as criminals and rapists, the group said, and it is "flabbergasted" by NBC's decision to put Trump on "SNL" on Nov. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We are appalled that you would enable Trump's hateful speech for nothing (more) than a ratings ploy and ask that you rescind the SNL invitation," the group said in a letter sent Thursday and released publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;NBC Universal, "SNL" and Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview earlier this week with Fox News Channel in which he was asked about similar criticism, Trump said he had no reaction, then added that polls show he's "doing very well with Hispanics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trump's appearance on "Saturday Night Live" will end up "sanitizing" his remarks with humor, said Felix Sanchez, who is chairman and co-founder of the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts and among those who signed the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;NBC Universal is being contradictory, Sanchez said, courting Hispanic viewers with its Spanish-language platforms but giving them a "slap in the face" by putting Trump on the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, which includes 40 national and regional civil rights and public policy groups, is reviewing further action, Sanchez said, including such options as staging protests the night of the telecast or calling for boycotts of the show or network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also suggested that cast members consider their own boycott, noting that in 1990 cast member Nora Dunn and pop singer Sinead O'Connor refused to appear on the show with host Andrew Dice Clay, with Dunn calling his comedy degrading to women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michaels' response at the time was to laud Dunn and her stand but insist that "the show will go on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;In its letter, the Hispanic coalition said the issue ultimately is Michaels' responsibility and called it part of a pattern involving him and "SNL."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group said it has been trying to meet with him since November 2013 to discuss the lack of Latino representation on the show and has yet to receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the complaints: The long-running program has never had a Latina cast member, and the use of non-Hispanic actors to play Latinas is equivalent to white performers using makeup to portray African-Americans, Sanchez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Number Of Yemeni Children At Risk Of Starving To Death Triples Since March

            <description>
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than half a million children in Yemen face life-threatening malnutrition as a risk of famine grows, a senior official of the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The figure, a three-fold jump since fighting erupted in March, reflects depleted food stocks compounded by a failing health system unable to care for hungry children or vaccinate them against disease, said Afshan Khan, director of UNICEF emergency programs worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We are facing the potential of a huge humanitarian catastrophe ... The levels of malnutrition that are being reported for children are extremely critical," Khan told Reuters, saying more data and hard evidence was needed to declare a famine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A nutritional survey will be done at the end of October. How close are we to a famine declaration? We see some zones that are worse than others," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to 537,000 children aged under five at risk of severe acute malnutrition, marked by visible wasting of their bodies, 1.3 million are moderately malnourished, according to the latest U.N. figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fewer than one in five therapeutic feeding centers across Yemen are functional, Khan said. UNICEF operates 43 mobile teams that screen children for malnutrition but areas such as the al Qaeda-held eastern province of Hadramawt are inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia has led an Arab military intervention against Houthi fighters since March 26 to restore the exiled Yemeni government and fend off what it sees as the creeping influence of the Shi'ite Muslim group's main ally, Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;At least 5,400 people have been killed in the conflict in the Arab world's poorest country where an estimated 10 percent of the 23 million population are now internally displaced. The death toll includes at least 502 children, UNICEF says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yemen, which imported 90 percent of its food before the crisis, is subject to a Saudi-led blockade imposed on commercial vessels, which are inspected by a U.N. verification mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We are allowed small passages of goods where the papers are clear," Khan said. "We have been unable to sufficiently replenish medical supplies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lack of fuel imports is preventing mills from grinding grain, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Humanitarian access is getting more and more difficult ...
